## Requirements
* Python 3.7 
* Cuda v11.0+
* gcc v7.3.0
* Pytorch 1.9.0+

## Pretrained BigGAN weights
Our annotation and model are based on BigGAN-512, please download the model from https://tfhub.dev/deepmind/biggan-512/2, store it in `./pretrain` folder. Since the original model is trained using TensorFlow, you need to convert the model weights back to Pytorch, following the instructions here https://github.com/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/tree/master/TFHub. Notice the model is Licensed under Apache-2.0 issued by DeepMind.

## Dataset preparation
We only release our annotations on sampled [BigGAN](https://github.com/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch/blob/master/LICENSE) images and images from [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/index.php) along with its latents used to get the sampled images. For their licenses, please refer to their websites. Notice our dataset release is under the [Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) license by NVIDIA Corporation. Please see [License](#license) session for details.

1. Download ImageNet from [here](https://www.image-net.org/index.php).
2. Download our annotations `annotations.zip` and latent codes `latents.zip` from [gdrive](). Unzip them into data folder under `./data/`.
3. Process images from ImageNet into our dataset format. Run the following script
```
python prepare_imagenet_images.py --imagenet_dir [path to imagenet dir] --dataset_dir ./data/
```
4. Prepare images generated from BigGAN. Please download the pretrained weights following [this](#pretrained-biggan-weights) session. And run
```
python prepare_biggan_images.py --biggan_ckpt ./pretrain/biggan-512.pth --dataset_dir ./data/
```
After the processing steps, you should have data folder structure like this
```
data

└───annotations
│   |
│   └───biggan512
│   |   │   n01440764
│   |   │   ...

└───latents
│   |

│   |   │   n01440764
│   |   │   ...
```

## Training
After the dataset preparation, we now can train BigDatasetGAN to synthesize dataset.

Run the following
```
python train.py --gan_ckpt ./pretrain/biggan-512.pth \
                --dataset_dir ./data/ \
                --save_dir ./logs/
```

You can monitor the training progress in tensorboard, as well as the training predictions in logs dir.

By default, the training runs 5k iteration with a batch size of 4, you can adjust it for the best capacity.

## Sampling dataset
After the training is done, we can synthesize ImageNet with pixel-wise labels.

Run the following
```
python sample_dataset.py --ckpt [path to your pretrained BigDatasetGAN weights] \
                         --save_dir ./dataset_viz/ \
                         --class_idx 225, 200, [you can give it more with ImagetNet class idx] \
                         --samples_per_class 10
                         --z_var 0.9
```

As an example, here we sample class 225 and 200 with 10 samples each.
